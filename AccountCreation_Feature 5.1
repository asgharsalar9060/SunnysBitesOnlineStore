Scenario: Account creation on DogDollars for existing vendors

Given vendor is on Sign Up page
When vender enters name
And vendor enters personal phone number
And vendor enters email
And vendor clicks on Next button
And vendor enters address
And vendor enters public phone number
And vendor chooses operation hours
And vendor enters DogDollars existing account number 
And vendor clicks on Create Account button
Then vendor gets 'Your account has been successfully created.' message

Note: I assume the new vendors should first create an account on Online Store to get an account number for DogDollars so the following scentario is for the new vendors.
